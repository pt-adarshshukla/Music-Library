Music Library is a dynamic and functional web-based music player built using HTML, JavaScript, and MP3 files. It provides an organized and interactive music streaming experience within a local network, designed as a lightweight alternative to platforms like Apple Music or Spotify.



Macro Vision Academy, Burhanpur is an Apple Distinguished School where students are provided with iPads and an iMac Lab for their academic learning. Students primarily study and access educational resources through these Apple devices. However, due to strict institutional firewall policies and device management profiles, students were restricted from accessing external websites, applications, and general internet content. They could only access study materials uploaded by the school through the internal FTP server.

To provide students with a refreshing and controlled entertainment experience within these restrictions, I, Adarsh Shukla, developed this Music Library Web Platform in early 2023. This project was created much before I later became the Technical Head of Macro Vision Academy (Batch 2024-25, Class 12).

The goal of this project was to design a secure, lightweight, and locally hosted music streaming platform that could operate within the school’s restricted network environment. The platform allowed students to listen to music daily during a permitted one-hour afternoon session, helping them relax while maintaining institutional discipline.

Originally, the project included a time-based access lock system, implemented using PHP and JavaScript, which restricted usage according to school rules. However, the time restriction feature has been removed in this uploaded version to keep the project simpler and more accessible for demonstration and development purposes.

Although this is an older project, it represents one of my early practical implementations of web development, focusing on solving real-world institutional challenges through technology. The coding and conceptual development of this project began well before its deployment in 2023, making it a foundational step in my journey toward software and web development.
